# Computer Simulations 2018-2019/2 @ ELTE

The course's initial purpose to get its students acquainted with numerical simulations of classical problems in physics. During the course, one needs to solve various tasks from 6 different topics, based on a simulation source code for every topic, which was created and made available in advance by the course's tutors. One needs to alter the source code in numerous ways, and analyze the output data to solve the given objectives. It is also required to make a documentation about the whole process for every subjects.  
The titles and abstracts of the topics are listed below. **For the original `C++` source codes, all credits goes to the tutors of the course!**

## I. Simulation: Harmonic Oscillator

## II. Simulation: Simple Pendulum

## III. Simulation: Planetary Motions

## IV. Simulation: Molecular Dynamics

## V. Simulation: Population Dynamics

## VI. Simulation: Cellular Automaton
