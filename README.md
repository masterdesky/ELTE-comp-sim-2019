# Computer Simulations 2018-2019/2 @ ELTE
#### Language: Hungarian

The course's initial purpose to get its students acquainted with numerical simulations of classical problems in physics. During the course, one needs to solve various tasks from 6 different topics, based on a simulation source code for every topic, which was created and made available in advance by the course's tutors. One needs to alter the source code in numerous ways, and analyze the output data to solve the given objectives. It is also required to make a documentation about the whole process for every subjects.  
The titles and abstracts of the topics are listed below. **For the original `C++` source codes, all credit goes to the tutors of the course!**

## I. Simulation: Harmonic Oscillator
For the first class of the *Computer Simulations* course, we studied the simple 1D harmonic oscillator and the numerical solution of its equation of motion. The class serves as an introductory for the course. The source code for the simulation was written on `C++` language, and the data analysis and the plotting was made with a Python 3 kernel running inside Jupyter Notebook. The first submission initial task was to get well known with the source code and then excercise by changing its input variables to achieve various runs with different initial conditions. Following this, we was needed to analyse the outputs according to given aspects and conditions.

## II. Simulation: Simple Pendulum
For the second class of the *Computer Simulations* course, we examined the numerical solutions of the differential equations of simple pendulums. We studied various approximations of the subject, like simple gravity pendulum, driven and/or damped pendulum and physical pendulum. We examined in contrast the simple fourth-order Runge-Kutta and stepsize controlled (adaptive) fourth-order Runge-Kutta, the Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp and adaptive Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp and the Euler and Euler-Cromer algorithms. Furthermore we also reviewed the same algorithms for the double pendulum.

## III. Simulation: Planetary Motions

## IV. Simulation: Molecular Dynamics

## V. Simulation: Population Dynamics

## VI. Simulation: Cellular Automaton
